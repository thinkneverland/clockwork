## Testing Strategy Overview

Tapped employs a multi-layered testing approach to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Feature Tests**: Test integration between components
3. **Browser Tests**: End-to-end tests using Laravel Dusk
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure overhead and resource usage
5. **Security Tests**: Validate authentication and data safety

## Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation.

### Key Components to Test

- **Data Collectors**
  - LivewireCollector
  - QueryCollector
  - EventCollector
  - RequestCollector

- **Services**
  - DebugStateSerializer
  - ScreenshotService
  - WebhookService
  - DebugInfoCollector

- **Core Classes**
  - TappedMiddleware
  - WebSocketServer

### Unit Test Guidelines

- Use mocks and stubs to isolate components
- Test each public method with various inputs
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage

## Feature Testing

Feature tests verify that components work correctly together.

### Key Scenarios to Test

- **API Endpoints**
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting
  - Response structure and content
  - Error handling

- **Middleware Integration**
  - Request lifecycle integration
  - Data collection during requests
  - WebSocket communication

- **Configuration**
  - Config file options
  - Environment variable overrides

### Feature Test Guidelines

- Use Laravel's HTTP testing tools
- Test API responses against expected JSON structure
- Verify correct HTTP status codes
- Test with and without authentication

## Browser Testing

Browser tests ensure end-to-end functionality using Laravel Dusk.

### Key User Flows to Test

- **Browser Extension Integration**
  - Extension connection to WebSocket
  - Real-time data updates
  - Component state editing
  - Event timeline visualization
  - Screenshot capture

- **Livewire Integration**
  - Component detection and inspection
  - State changes
  - Event tracking
  - N+1 query detection

### Browser Test Guidelines

- Use Dusk for browser automation
- Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- Verify UI elements and interactions
- Test WebSocket reconnection scenarios

## Performance Testing

Performance tests measure the impact and overhead of Tapped.

### Key Metrics to Test

- **Memory Usage**
  - Baseline memory without Tapped
  - Memory usage with Tapped enabled
  - Memory usage during different operations

- **Response Time**
  - Impact on page load time
  - WebSocket communication latency
  - API endpoint response times

- **CPU Usage**
  - Processing overhead during request handling
  - WebSocket server resource usage

### Performance Test Guidelines

- Measure with and without Tapped enabled
- Test under various load conditions
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Set acceptable performance thresholds

## Security Testing

Security tests validate protection mechanisms.

### Key Security Aspects to Test

- **API Authentication**
  - Token validation
  - Token expiration
  - Access control

- **WebSocket Security**
  - Connection authentication
  - Data encryption
  - Reconnection security

- **Data Privacy**
  - Sensitive data filtering
  - Storage security
  - Webhook payload security

### Security Test Guidelines

- Attempt unauthorized access
- Test with invalid tokens
- Verify encryption of sensitive data
- Check for exposure of credentials

## Manual Testing Checklist

Manual testing complements automated tests for subjective aspects.

### Browser Extension

- [ ] Install extension in Chrome
- [ ] Install extension in Firefox
- [ ] Install extension in Edge
- [ ] Connect to application
- [ ] View component state
- [ ] Edit component properties
- [ ] View event timeline
- [ ] Analyze N+1 queries
- [ ] Capture screenshots
- [ ] Create and restore snapshots

### IDE Integrations

- [ ] VS Code extension installation
- [ ] VS Code commands functionality
- [ ] JetBrains plugin installation
- [ ] JetBrains plugin functionality
- [ ] CLI tool commands
- [ ] REST client integration

### General User Experience

- [ ] UI responsiveness
- [ ] Dark/light mode
- [ ] Error messages clarity
- [ ] Documentation completeness

## Continuous Integration

CI/CD pipeline automates testing and deployment.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- Runs on push to main/dev branches and pull requests
- Tests against multiple PHP and Laravel versions
- Runs unit, feature, and browser tests
- Performs code quality checks
- Generates code coverage reports

### Release Process

1. All tests must pass before release
2. Code quality checks must pass
3. Documentation must be updated
4. CHANGELOG must be updated
5. Version must be incremented according to semver

## Release Testing

Final validation before release.

### Release Checklist

- [ ] Manual testing checklist completed
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and updated
- [ ] Compatibility with supported Laravel versions verified
- [ ] Compatibility with supported Livewire versions verified
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable thresholds
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Version bumped according to semver

### Post-Release Monitoring

- Monitor GitHub issues for bug reports
- Track usage metrics
- Collect user feedback
